# Koa

[Koa](http://koajs.com/) is next generation web framework for NodeJS. Its powerful middleware architecture is built on top of generators. We are going to see how Koa uses generators.


I> Koa [v1.x](https://github.com/koajs/koa/tree/master) uses generators. However, [v2.x](https://github.com/koajs/koa/tree/v2.x) switches to using `async/await`. We only discuss Koa v1.x here.
